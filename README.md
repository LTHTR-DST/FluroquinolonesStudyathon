To start download this entire repository (you can download as a zip folder using Code -> Download ZIP, or you can use GitHub Desktop). 

1) Go to folder <i>1_StudyCode</i> and open the project <i>fluroquinolones.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
2) Open and work though the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on.
