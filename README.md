### Task 1: Run drug exposure diagnostics
1) Go to folder "DrugExposureDiagnostics" and open the project <i>DrugExposureDiagnostics.Rproj</i> in RStudio (when inside the project, you will see its name on the top-right of your RStudio session)
2) Open and work though the <i>CodeToRun.R</i> file which should be the only file that you need to interact with. Run the lines in the file, adding your database specific information and so on.
3) After running you should then have a zip folder with results to share in your results folder. To view the results, go to 1b_fluroquinolones_diagnostics_shiny/DrugExposureDiagnosticsShiny.Rproj, add unzipped results to the data folder,  and launch the app from ui.R
